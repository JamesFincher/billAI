```typescript
// Anomaly Detection
const threshold = 2 * standardDeviation;
const difference = Math.abs(billInstance.amount - average);

// Seasonal Adjustment
const adjustment = sameMonthAverage / overallAverage;

// Efficiency Scoring
const efficiency = Math.max(0.1, Math.min(2.0, averageUsage / currentUsage));
```
